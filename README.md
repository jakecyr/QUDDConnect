# QUDDConnect
The main goal of the QUDD Connect system is to provide a way for students to connect with other students who are also interested in transferring dining dollar funds. The application will allow users to find other students that they can buy dining dollars from. The application will also allow users to sell their dining dollars to other students. 

The code must be run on a local or external server in order to work properly due to cross-origin JavaScript issues.

To run the code:

1. Download and install MAMP (preferably the PRO trial version): https://www.mamp.info/en/
2. Clone the git repo containing the code and move the code folder to the MAMP htdocs folder
3. Run the MAMP servers
4. Go to localhost:8888 to view the code running
	- Any change you make to the code in the htdocs folder will be visible once you refresh the page
